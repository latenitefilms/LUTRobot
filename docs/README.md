# LUT Robot

**Advanced LUT Management for Final Cut Pro.**

Unlike Final Cut Pro's built-in Custom LUT and Camera LUT tools, **LUT Robot** allows you to "link" to a LUT stored in any folder.

It also allows you to apply LUTs in bulk to clips - for example, if you have a unique LUT for each of your rushes files.

LUT Robot is currently in active development. We hope to release a beta on FxFactory towards the end of January 2024.
