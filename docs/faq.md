## Why FxFactory?

All our initial paid apps, such as [BRAW Toolbox](https://brawtoolbox.io), [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://gyroflowtoolbox.io), [Marker Toolbox](https://markertoolbox.io), [Recall Toolbox](https://recalltoolbox.io) and [Fast Collections](https://fastcolletions.io) were all released on the Apple Mac Store.
